/*Conclusion of Question No 1:

 What we did first make a function with the name of vovel2 Passing an Argument with the name of str and give the type string, than make a 
variable with the name of vovel2 in which passing the value of vovels in an Array. Then make another variable with the name of count and it assign 0.
Than use for loop to iterate if vovel2 include so increament in count++ othervise return count.


Conclusion of Question No 2:

We all know that Prime number is divisible by itSelf or 1, So we Apply the condition according them, like the first condition,
if(num<=1) it means if number is less than 1 or equal to 1 return false because every number is divisible by 1 and every number is not prime number.
Then, if(divisor === number) return true , its obvious we tell you prime number are those which is divide by itself so if both are same it means
true. Then we use recursive if(num % divisor === 0) return false, it means if number is divide with divisor and quiotient === 0 it means it's not
a prime number. In the end we return function by increament in the divisor because to meet the conditions.


Conclusion of Question No 3:
First create a function called firstNonRepeatedCharater passing an argument str type string return string or null, then
create a new Map in charCount variable . The work of new Map is to store the count of each character in the input string,representing the
charaters and the value type is number, representing the count occurence of each word, then
use of loop for str to check with the help of charCount.set to how many times this str appear if not appear then retur than count 0 otherwise 
increament by 1 than, again loop to check if  char of str === 1 through cahrCount.get then return char it means the first one who is not repeated
anymore retun it. else not exist any character then return null 



Conclusion of Question No 4 & 5:
we just use basic function method nothing more than that.
